title: Understanding Templates

syntax:
  title: Syntax
  intro: >
    Ember's template syntax is an intentionally simple language so that the underlying GlimmerVM can be fast.
    It is built on Symbolic Expressions
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">
      S-Expressions
    </a>)
    which is a tree-based structure for helping simplify syntax, building, and parsing templates.
    <br>
    If you're familiar with TypeScript syntax, you could define the template syntax using this pseudo grammar here, like so,
  plain-function: >
    Note that plain function helpers are not supported yet without

    the help of a
    <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0625-helper-managers.md">
      Helper Manager
    </a>
    <br>
    such as what is provided by the addon
    <a href="https://github.com/pzuraq/ember-could-get-used-to-this">
      ember-could-get-used-to-this
    </a>. However, there is RFC that propose making this a default behavior,
    <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/756">
      RFC#756: Default Helper Manager
    </a>

notation:
  title: Notation
  intro: >
    Unlike JavaScript, Ember templates use
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation">
      Polish Notation
    </a>
    or <em>Prefix Notation</em> which means that operators (or functions) <em>precede</em> their operands (arguments).
