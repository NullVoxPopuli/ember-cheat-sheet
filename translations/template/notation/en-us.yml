title: Notation
description: >
  Unlike JavaScript, Ember templates use
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation">
    Polish Notation
  </a>
  or <em>Prefix Notation</em> which means that operators (or functions) <em>precede</em> their operands (arguments).
js-equiv: which is the equivalent of this, in JavaScript

notes: >
  In older versions of ember, you may need an addon for helpers like <code>or</code> and <code>not</code>,
  such as: <a href="https://github.com/jmurphyau/ember-truth-helpers">ember-truth-helpers</a>
