  intro: >
    Ember's template syntax is an intentionally simple language so that the underlying GlimmerVM can be fast.
    It is built on
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">
      S-Expressions
    </a>
    which is a tree-based structure for helping simplify syntax, building, and parsing templates.
