  title: Syntax
  intro: >
    Ember's template syntax is an intentionally simple language so that the underlying GlimmerVM can be fast.
    It is built on Symbolic Expressions
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">
      S-Expressions
    </a>)
    which is a tree-based structure for helping simplify syntax, building, and parsing templates.

    If you're familiar with TypeScript syntax, you could define the template syntax using this pseudo grammar here, like so,

notation:
  title: Description
  intro: >
    Unlike JavaScript, Ember templates use
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation">
      Polish Notation
    </a>
    or <em>Prefix Notation</em> which means that operators <em>precede</em> their operands.
