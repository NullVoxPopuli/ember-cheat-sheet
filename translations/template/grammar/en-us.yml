title: Grammar
description: >
  Ember's template grammar is an intentionally simple language so that the underlying GlimmerVM can be fast.
  It is built on Symbolic Expressions
  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-Expressions</a>)
  which is a tree-based structure for helping simplify syntax, building, and parsing templates.
  <br>
  If you're familiar with TypeScript, you could define the template grammar using this pseudo-code here, like so,
plain-function: >
  Note that plain function helpers are not supported yet without the help of a
  <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0625-helper-managers.md">Helper Manager</a>
  such as what is provided by
  <a href="https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-functions-as-helper-polyfill">ember-functions-as-helper-polyfill</a>. 
  The RFC that proposes making this a default behavior,
  <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/756">RFC#756: Default Helper Manager</a>, is in-progress.

expression-breakdown: >
  In this example, <code>a</code> can <em>only</em> be a helper. Each of
  <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, and <code>e</code>
  cannot be anything other than plain values because functions cannot
  be invoked without surrounding parenthesis.
