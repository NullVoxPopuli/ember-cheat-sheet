title: Grammar
description: >
  Ember's template grammar is an intentionally simple language so that the underlying GlimmerVM can be fast.
  It is built on Symbolic Expressions
  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">
    S-Expressions
  </a>)
  which is a tree-based structure for helping simplify syntax, building, and parsing templates.
  <br>
  If you're familiar with TypeScript, you could define the template grammar using this pseudo-code here, like so,
plain-function: >
  Note that plain function helpers are not supported yet without

  the help of a
  <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0625-helper-managers.md">
    Helper Manager
  </a>
  <br>
  such as what is provided by the addon
  <a href="https://github.com/pzuraq/ember-could-get-used-to-this">
    ember-could-get-used-to-this
  </a>. However, there is RFC that propose making this a default behavior,

    RFC#756: Default Helper Manager
  </a>

expression-breakdown: >
  In this example, <code>a</code> can <em>only</em> be a helper. Each of
  <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, and <code>e</code>
  cannot be anything other than plain values because functions cannot
  be invoked without surrounding parenthesis.
