title: Defining Variables
description: >
  Using <code>let</code> is the only way to define variables inline in templates. Because <code>let</code> is a block-helper, it means that scope is consistent with other blocks in templates as well. This is different from languages like JavaScript, where defining a variable is accessible to the "current scope" -- with <code>let</code>, you create a new scope.

example: >
  In this example, an array is created and then available within the <code>let</code> block as <code>list</code>. It can be iterated over just as any array defined in JavaScript would be.
