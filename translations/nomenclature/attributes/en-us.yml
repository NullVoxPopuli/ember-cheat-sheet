splattributes: >
  There is also splatted attributes or "splattributes", which represent forwarding all passed attributes from a calling context
  to the element which has <code>...attributes</code> on it. Note that <em>arguments</em> are not included in <code>...attributes</code>.

  In this example below, if this div were to represent the template for <code>SomeComponent</code> above, the <code>class</code>,
  <code>data-test</code>, and <code>style</code> attributes would be applied to the div.
